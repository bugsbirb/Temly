# 🐷 Temly / TriMelERM
> It's a roblox moderation website, it has a dashboard + a modpanel and etc.
> You can play around with this on https://temly.bugze.me.

> I started this project near the start of **September**, and have spent around **100 hours on this project**. Which may seem like a long time for what's been done, but from this experience I've learned a lot.


## Todo List
> - Make a docker compose so it's more easily hosted.
> - Use less `any` types in the frontend.
> - Organise the code better in C#.
> - Improve some of the code, and inconsistentcy, so I don't make the dog mad.
> - Clean up classes in C#
> - Split more stuff into reusable functions in C#.
> - Finish ERLC
> - Auto Refresh data on ERLC
> - Finish the members section, so you can kick and change peoples roles.
